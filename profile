Hi! I'm a science graduate with a strong passion for data and problem-solving. After several years of experience working in medical labs, I transitioned into the world of data analysis to combine my background in biochemistry with modern data tools.

I completed a professional data analysis program at AMIT Learning, where I gained hands-on experience in:

📊 Excel

🐍 Python

🧮 SQL

📈 Power BI

📉 Statistics

Here on GitHub, I share my data analysis projects — from cleaning datasets and building dashboards to running statistical models and data visualizations. I'm especially interested in biostatistics and bioinformatics, and I'm excited to keep growing in this field.

🚀 I'm currently:
Building real-world data projects using Python and Power BI

Exploring opportunities as a junior data analyst

Planning to pursue studies in Biostatistics or Bioinformatics

Always learning something new!
